# Shopping Cart 🛒

The development of the Shopping Cart project focused on Asynchronous JavaScript, using the ``Mercado Livre API``.

In the application, I used the Mercado Livre API to ``list products`` and develop a dynamic ``shopping e-commerce``.

I also used the API to:

```
▪️ Add these products to cart
▪️ Remove products from cart
▪️ Update cart total price in real time
```
When loading the page, items added to the shopping cart are retrieved from LocalStorage.

I also used the ``AwesomeAPI`` and ``BrasilAPI-CEP`` APIs to obtain location data based on the informed zip code.

Developed unit tests to validate functions developed using the Jest Framework.
