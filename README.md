## Shopping Cart 🛒

The development of the Shopping Cart project was focused on Asynchronous JavaScript, using the ``Mercado Livre API``.

In the application, I used the Mercado Livre API to ``list products`` and to develop a dynamic ``shopping e-commerce``.

I also used the API to:

```
▪️ Add these products to the cart
▪️ Remove products from the cart
▪️ Update the cart total price in real time
```
When loading the page, items added to the shopping cart are retrieved from LocalStorage.

I also used the ``AwesomeAPI`` and ``BrasilAPI-CEP`` APIs to obtain the location data based on the informed zip code.

I developed unit tests to validate functions using the Jest Framework.
